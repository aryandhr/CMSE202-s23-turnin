Using the dubgger in VSCode is a great tool to see what values your variables are taking, how they are getting updated as your code runs, what exactly your functions are outputting and much more. One debugging tool I have recently discovered is pythontutor which a website where you can run your Python code and it takes you step by step through the code and tells you what each line is doing. It is always okay to Google your errors, ask for help on Slack, go to helprooms. However, it is not okay to plagiarize code and let someone else fix your code. You must understand why your code isn't working and then fix the problem."
